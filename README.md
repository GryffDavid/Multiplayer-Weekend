# Multiplayer-Weekend
This small local multiplayer arena platformer was made over the course of a weekend from the 25th to the 27th of November 2016. The idea was to make a simple, fun, fast-paced shooter that I could play with friends with the idea being that we could add features we wanted as we saw fit. I was inspired by how much fun we had playing Towerfall Ascension and feeling that rush of perfectly executing someone with a well-placed arrow. I kept track of the goals over the course of the weekend in a text file.

- Able to use controllers for local multiplayer (DONE)
- Able to use multiple computers for LAN multiplayer
- Score count and limit (DONE)
- At least 3 types of gun (Kind of DONE)
- Grenades (DONE)

## Other Ideas
- Teleporters - That can portal bullets too
- Melee attack
- Health packs
- Ammo packs (DONE)
- Bounce pads
- Gibs (DONE)
- Moving platforms
- Wall jumping
- Double jumping (DONE)

I was pretty happy with how this project turned out. I ended up playing this game with my brother and his girlfriend and it was amazing to see how much fun it was with us all shouting at each other
